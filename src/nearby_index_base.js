    NEARBY INDEX BASE

/**
 * Abstract superclass for NearbyIndexe.
 * 
 * Superclass used to check that a class implements the nearby() method, 
 * and provide some convenience methods.
 * 
 * NEARBY INDEX
 * 
 * NearbyIndex provides indexing support of effectivelylooking up ITEMS by offset, 
 * given that
 * (i) each entriy is associated with an interval and,
 * (ii) entries are non-overlapping.
 * Each ITEM must be associated with an interval on the timeline 
 * 
 * NEARBY
 * The nearby method returns information about the neighborhood around offset. 
 * 
 * Returns {
 *      left - high interval endpoint of the first ITEM to the left which does not cover offset, else undefined
 *      center - list of ITEMS covering offset, else []
 *      right - low interval endpoint of the first ITEM to the right which does not cover offset, else undefined
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * INTERVALS
 * 
 * [low, high, lowInclusive, highInclusive]
 * 
 * This representation ensures that the interval endpoints are ordered and allows
 * intervals to be exclusive or inclusive, yet cover the entire real line 
 * 
 * [a,b], (a,b), [a,b), [a, b) are all valid intervals
 * 
 * 
 * INTERVAL ENDPOINTS
 * 
 * interval endpoints are defined by [value, sign], for example
 * 
 * 4) -> [4,-1] - endpoint is on the left of 4
 * [4, 4, 4] -> [4, 0] - endpoint is at 4 
 * (4 -> [4, 1] - endpoint is on the right of 4)
